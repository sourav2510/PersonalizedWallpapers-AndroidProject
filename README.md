# PersonalizedWallpapers-AndroidProject

### Add your own google-services.json file in project's app directory to run the application

This is an app in which we can have our own favourite customised HD Wallpapers. 
We can set these wallpapers in mobile by just clicking on the Set Wallpaper button. 
I have used Firebase for storing the wallpapers and to minimize the app size. 
The wallpapers are being loaded instantly during starting up of the app.  
There is a feature of sign up and login but for saving the usage time I have set it to anonymous login, so that user donâ€™t have to register and login by 
themselves, the app automatically does it in a fraction of second.
